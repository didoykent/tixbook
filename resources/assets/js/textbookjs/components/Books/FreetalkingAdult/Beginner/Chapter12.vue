               <div style="padding : 16px;">

<p>This morning, I went to the supermarket to buy some groceries. I was exhilarated because there was a sale! I got 20% discount on meat products and 30% on fruits and vegetables. When I found out the snack bars were discounted by 80%, I was super happy! I loaded up a whole cart just with them! I went home whistling with happiness. However, I couldn't have been more disappointed with myself when my youngest daughter said out of the blue, "Mom, all these snack bars are going to expire in two days." Oh well, I think we will have to eat some and give some away tomorrow. What a waste!

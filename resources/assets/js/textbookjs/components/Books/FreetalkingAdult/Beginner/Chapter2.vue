   <p>My family had a memorable trip to Jeju Island in the autumn of 2010.  I was twenty years old at that time.  We rode an airplane from Seoul and it took us about an hour to get there.   The wind was strong   and fresh. The land was green with grass. We climbed the Halla Mountain. I was very thrilled. We also swam in a beach.  The water was very clear. We ate black pigs and a special orange   fruit. My trip to Jeju Island is unforgettable!

<p>My best friend and I went to New York last summer vacation. We went there because we wanted to see the Statue of Liberty. When we finally saw it, it was bigger than we expected! It was gigantic! We bought mini­-replicas as souvenirs. We also ate a lot of Western food like hamburger and pizza. During our last day, our new American friend named Mary gave us a free tour of the City. It was a fantastic trip!

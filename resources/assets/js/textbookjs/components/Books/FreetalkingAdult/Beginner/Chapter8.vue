<p>There is a saying "No man is an island."  My elementary school teacher told us it meant no man can live alone. As time passed by, I began to understand its meaning entirely. Although socially awkward, I don't think I can live without my friends even if there are only a handful of them.  My friends cheer me up and support me. Friendship is a wonderful and splendid thing. It is very important because for many times, it has been a cause of joy, comfort and strength to me.

<p>There was an ancient Greek story about two friends named Damon and Pythias. They grew up in the same town and were childhood friends. One day when they were visiting Syracuse, Pythias was arrested because he insulted the king. He was to be killed but he begged the king to give him a chance to say goodbye to his family.
Of course, the king didn't allow him temporary freedom for the fear that he wouldn't come back. Damon volunteered to take his place. If Pythias could not return in a month, then Damon has to be killed in his place. The King was surprised at this. He thought Damon was very stupid to sacrifice himself. Meanwhile, Pythias went back home and said goodbye to his family.
</p>
<p>
  One month had passed and just about Damon was to be killed, Pythias arrived in filthy, worn-out clothes.
The king was amazed at their friendship! He withdrew his punishment and made them his counselors in the royal court.
